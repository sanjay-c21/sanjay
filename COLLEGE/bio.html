        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Hello! My name is sanjay, and I'm learning html program with a passion for creating intuitive and efficient web webpage. I was born and raised in chennai, Illinois, where I developed an early interest in technology and design. From building simple websites in high school to working on enterprise applications today, my journey has been one of continuous learning and growth.
        </p>
        <p>
            I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Illinois. During my time there, I was involved in several tech clubs and even started my own side project with friendsâ€”a mobile app to help students organize their class schedules. That project ignited my love for building user-friendly digital tools that solve real-world problems.
        </p>
        <p>
            After college, I joined a tech startup where I worked on both front-end and back-end systems. The fast-paced environment helped me hone my skills in JavaScript, Python, and cloud computing. I particularly enjoy working on user experience (UX) and making sure the applications I build are not just functional but also enjoyable to use.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, photography, and volunteering at local coding bootcamps where I mentor aspiring developers. I believe in lifelong learning and constantly seek opportunities to expand my skill set. My goal is to continue building technology that makes people's lives easier and more connected.
